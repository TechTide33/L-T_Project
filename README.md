# Room Automation System — L-T Project

## Aim
To design and simulate a room automation system in Cisco Packet Tracer that automatically manages the room lamp and ceiling fan based on the door state (open = day, closed = night), and to provide remote monitoring/control via a smartphone in the simulation.

## Problem Statement
Modern homes increasingly rely on automation to improve comfort, save energy, and enable remote monitoring. In this project, a room automation system is developed using Cisco Packet Tracer, where the lamp and ceiling fan operate automatically depending on the door’s state. The door is used as a logical condition to represent day (open) and night (closed).  

- Door open (Day): Lamp OFF, Fan HIGH  
- Door closed (Night): Lamp ON, Fan OFF  

The system can also be remotely monitored and controlled through a smartphone in the simulation.

## Scope of the Solution
- Demonstrates Industrial IoT in home automation using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
- Focus on automation of lamp and fan with door condition (day/night simulation).  
- Provides remote monitoring and control through smartphone/PC in Packet Tracer.  
- Can be extended with sensors, garage door, windows, or alarms in future versions.

## Required Components
### Software / IDE
- Cisco Packet Tracer (v7.x or above) — for IoT simulation  
- Built-in IoT configuration tools (no external IDE required)  

### Simulated Hardware (in Packet Tracer)
- Wireless Router (for device connectivity)  
- Smart Door (condition trigger)  
- Smart Lamp  
- Smart Fan  
- Smart Phone / PC (for remote monitoring/control)  
- Optional: IoT Server for device management
